### 1.[Merge Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/description/)

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

```java
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int p1 = m-1, p2 = n-1, i = m+n-1;
        while(p2 >= 0){
            if(p1 >= 0 && nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]){
                nums1[i--] = nums1[p1--];
            }
            else{
                nums1[i--] = nums2[p2--];
            }
        }
    }
}
```
